# Intro

My name is James N. Thomas. This is my personal website and blog. I'm currently a computer science master's student, and I work in the research and development arm of a privately owned software development company. I plan on this blog being a mostly informal catch-all for anything I find interesting in computer science, mathematics, or whatever else. Feel free to take a look at my projects in the tab up top and don't hesitate to drop me a few lines through the contact page.
